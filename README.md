# Toxic Comment Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect toxic comments in text data. Toxic comments include various forms of online harassment, such as hate speech, threats, and insults, which can harm the online community and individual users. By identifying and filtering out such comments, the project aims to contribute to a safer and more inclusive online environment.

## Objectives
- Develop a robust model to classify comments as toxic or non-toxic.
- Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze text data.
- Implement various machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective approach.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Deploy the model using Gradio to create a user-friendly web interface.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful features from the text data.
- **Model Training**: Training and tuning various machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance and selecting the best-performing model.
- **Deployment**: Setting up the model for real-time comment detection using Gradio.

## Datasets
The project uses publicly available datasets containing labeled comments. The datasets include various types of toxic comments, such as insults, threats, and hate speech, along with non-toxic comments for a balanced training set.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, TensorFlow, Gradio
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git
